This project uses K-Means clustering to interpret different market regimes (such as bear, bullish, sideways) in the S&P 500 from 2010-2025 based on price behavior. Output includes a cluster-labelled graph with volatility, momentum and returns.

Tools Used
- Python
- 'pandas' for data handling
- 'yfinance' for pulling stock data
- 'matplotlib' for visualisation
- 'scikit-learn' for K-Means and scaling

What I learnt
- How to apply unsupervised ML to S&P 500
- Interpreting clusters as market regimes
